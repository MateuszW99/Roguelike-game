# Roguelike-game
This project is based on this tutorial: https://roguesharp.wordpress.com/2016/02/20/roguesharp-v3-tutorial-introduction-and-goals/

Things I implemented are:
- gold looting, gold stays on the ground untill the player collects it;
- columns which are randomly generated obstacles for player;
- two categories for items: passive items, increasing stats of the player, and
  active items with quickbar at the top of the screen;
- fixed a bug where getting on a new floor would place player in an unwalkable space.

More updates on the way.
