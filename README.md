# Roguelike-game
This project is based on this tutorial: https://roguesharp.wordpress.com/2016/02/20/roguesharp-v3-tutorial-introduction-and-goals/

Things I implemented are:
- gold looting, gold stays on the ground untill the player collects it.
- columns which are randomly generated obstacles for player.

More updates on the way.
